## About

Moon base map for the [Unvanquished](https://unvanquished.net) game.

This map features an infected human base on the surface of the Moon. It started as a map concept in the early days of Unvanquished development and was revived lately as a community map.

This map is meant to be edited with the [NetRadiant](https://netradiant.gitlab.io/) level editor and built using [Urcheon](https://github.com/DaemonEngine/Urcheon).
